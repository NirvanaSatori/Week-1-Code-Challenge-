# Week-1-Code-Challenge-
## In the speed-detector.js file:
This is a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 
A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.
The function takes in an input and Calculates the total number of demerit points.
## In the student-grade-generator file:
We write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
The function takes in an input, and using a Switch case, it  outputs the results in the console.
## In the tutorials.js file:
We write a program that takes in a tutorial array where it capitalizes the first letter of every word and returns it .
The function takes in an array and uses the split attribute to turn each word into a string. 
It in turn capitalizes the first letter of every word and returns it.
